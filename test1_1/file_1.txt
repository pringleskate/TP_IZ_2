Few of us like to be told we are average. Americans are no exception. Generalizations about nationalities (like, Americans are optimists, or Germans are professional pessimists) are not usually welcomed, even if they are truthful.

One generalization often made about Americans is that they value their individualism quite high. They pay great attention to their individual differences; to a great number of various choices in their lives; and to the opportunity to do things their own way.
