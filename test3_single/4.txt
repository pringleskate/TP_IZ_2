I have English on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. English is usually the second lesson.

At the English lesson we speak, read and write. We speak about school, pupils and teachers, about lessons, animals and nature, about our friends, sports and games. We read books and stories about children, nature, school life and so on. We write letters, words, sentences, exercises and dictations.

We play at English, too. We sing songs and learn poems.

I like English. I can read and write well, but I canâ€™t speak English well yet.
